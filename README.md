# Odin-Recipes

Recipe App Powered by The Odin Project

This project is made using html and css at a basic level. The contents of this project are commonly made home recipes by including some descriptions. This is my first project, so i hope this can be my first step to become a programmer with a proficient skill that can help many people with the applications that I will make in the future
